# flap-bird-lua

- This was only possible because of the work of Colton T. Ogden and Harvard's CS50. 
- Specially thanks to freeCodeCamp.org for [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBHusPevM5k) video



# About 

- This is a Flappy Bird game made entirely in [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) using the framework [Love 2d Engine](https://love2d.org/)
- This is a copy of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBHusPevM5k) video implementation with addition of a Config state and architecture improvements

# Running 

- First, install [Love 2d Engine](https://love2d.org/) for Windows, Linux or Mac. It comes with Lua builted-in, of course. 
- Then run `love main.lua` and enjoy
